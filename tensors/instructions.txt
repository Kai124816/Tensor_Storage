1. Use wget and the URL of the tensor you want to test. This should return a .gz file
2. Use gunzip to unzip the .gz file.
3. Compile the clean_tns.cc file using the command g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -o clean_tns clean_tns.cc
4. Use the object file to clean out the tensor: (Ex)./clean_tns amazon-reviews.tns 
5. Use the command wc -l tensor.tns to see if the number of non zeros was modified
6. Run your program
7. Remove the tensor file to save space

Note: you can use the head -n 100 to read the first 100 lines of the file and to check what data
type the file is
